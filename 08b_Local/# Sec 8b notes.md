# Converting Local Expressions

When dealing with local expressions in programming, there are several steps that need to be taken to ensure proper execution. These steps are:

1. For each locally defined function or constant, rename it and all references to it to a globally unique name.
2. Lift the local definition(s) to the top level with any existing global definitions.
3. Replace the local expression with the body of the local in which all references to the defined functions and constants have been renamed.

Here's an example of how this process might work in the Racket programming language:

```racket
(define b 1)
(+ b
   (local [(define b 2)]
     (* b b))
   b)
```

In this code, we have a local expression that defines a new value for the constant `b`. To convert this expression, we follow the steps outlined above:

1. We rename the locally defined `b` and all references to it to a globally unique name (e.g. `b_0`).
2. We lift the definition of `b_0` to the top level with any existing global definitions.
3. We replace the local expression with the body of the local, in which all references to `b` have been renamed to `b_0`.

Here's the converted code:

```racket
(define b 1)
(+ 1
   (define b_0 2)
   (* b_0 b_0)
   b)
```

This new code is equivalent to the original local expression, but with the locally defined `b` renamed to `b_0` and lifted to the top level.
