For a shared expression:

The evaluation of shared is truly one of the deep mysteries of the universe. There are two very different ways to describe the evaluation rules.

One cannot be described exactly in terms of BSL (or ISL), but informally goes as follows:

Each of the variables is defined as a constant with a special unique dummy value.
Then the expressions are evaluated.
Then each of the constants has its value change to the corresponding value. This is the part we have no words for in BSL or ISL, it is called mutation.
Finally each of those values is traversed and each time one of the dummy values appears it is replaced in-situ by the corresponding value. (A different form of mutation.)
This evaluation rule for shared is cumbersome but goes beyond what we know
