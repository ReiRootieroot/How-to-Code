Presented by [UBCx's MicroMasters Program in Software Development](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ubcx-software-development) (University of British Columbia) on [EdX](https://www.edx.org/). The courses taught are How to Code: Simple Data and How to Code: Complex Data.

**Program**: Racket

The files in each section are my custom code to the practice problems and quizzes given at the conclusion of each section along with additional problems from the Problem Bank. Each section is tagged with the appropriate course under "Tags" and be observed in the "Grouped by tags" view.

My intention of learning through this course is to deepen my understanding of effective data and function design whilst designing an entire system. I do not intend to specialize Racket down the road after these courses. As such, it is best to understand my work in here as proof of a good understanding of how to designate pieces of data, how to design functions utilizing said data, and a basic understanding of fundamental computer science concepts.

The course objectives are given below for each respective course. Please visit each webpage linked in the headers for a full overview.

### [How to Code: Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data)

- How to represent information as data
- How to focus each part of your program on a single task
- How to use examples and tests to clarify what your program should do
- How to simplify the structure of your program using common patterns
- Recognize and represent more complicated information

### [How to Code: Complex Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-complex-data)

- How to identify commonalities in data definitions and functions
- How to avoid repetition using abstraction
- How to design functions that operate on graphs
- How to design programs that search a given problem space to find a valid solution
