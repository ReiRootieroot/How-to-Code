When the information in the program's domain is of arbitrary size, a well-formed self-referential (or mutually referential) data definition is needed.

In order to be well-formed, a self-referential data definition must:

(i) have at least one case without self reference (the base case(s))
(ii) have at least one case with self reference
The template contains a base case corresponding to the non-self-referential clause(s) as well as one or more natural recursions corresponding to the self-referential clauses.

;; ListOfString is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons String ListOfString)
;; interp. a list of strings

(define LOS-1 empty)
(define LOS-2 (cons "a" empty))
(define LOS-3 (cons "b" (cons "c" empty)))

#;
(define (fn-for-los los)
  (cond [(empty? los) (...)]                   ;BASE CASE
        [else (... (first los)                 ;String
                   (fn-for-los (rest los)))])) ;NATURAL RECURSION
;;             /
;;            /
;;       COMBINATION
;; Template rules used:
;;  - one of: 2 cases
;;  - atomic distinct: empty
;;  - compound: (cons String ListOfString)
;;  - self-reference: (rest los) is ListOfString


In some cases a types comment can have both self-reference and reference to another type.
